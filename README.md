# Why You Shouldn't Build Me...

**I highly recommend that you do NOT build this clock directly.** It was designed as a very quick prototype and lacks a lot of features, such as the ability to set the time without connecting to the Arduino over serial...

This repo is here largely for my own reference, and maybe as inspiration for others. 

I'm in the process of making V2.0 as part of [Fab Academy 2015](http://www.fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/fablab/). You can follow the process on [my class website](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/chalmers.iain/index.html). The content is also mirrored to [my GitHub Pages site](http://icchalmers.github.io/).

When V2.0 is ready, I will link to it here.

# WordClock_v1.0

![wordclock](/wordClock_v1.jpg)

This is the word clock that I designed for my Mum's Christmas in 2014. The clock was designed in Inventor and the part faces exported as .dwg for importing into CorelDRAW for laser cutting.

The LEDs are 11 strips of 11 WS2812b LEDs (based on 60 LEDs per metre strips).

The controller is an Arduino Uno with a cheapo DS3232 module from China.

# Inspiration

This clock was inspired by [this igmur post](http://imgur.com/a/iMXmj?gallery). It was also inspired by the work of Doug Jackson from http://www.dougswordclocks.com/ and uses some of the code from his [The Word Clock - Arduino Version](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Word-Clock-Arduino-version/) on Instructables.
